# AI Prompts for Product Managers

> A structured, version-controlled prompt library for Product Managers using GenAI across the product lifecycle.

## Overview

This repo organizes proven PM prompts into a **Claude Code**–compatible skill structure. Each prompt is a standalone markdown template you can copy, customize, and run across Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, or any other AI assistant.

The library covers the full PM workflow — from customer discovery and competitive analysis through to stakeholder alignment, strategy, and executive communication. Every prompt follows the same structure: context, inputs, and a defined output format so you get consistent, usable results.

The library contains 16 categories, 35+ prompts, and 11 worked examples.

## Usage

### Install as a Claude Code Skill

The skill is already installed for project-scoped use — `.claude/skills/ai-pm-prompts/SKILL.md` is included in this repo. When you open this directory in Claude Code, the skill is detected automatically with no setup required.

Skills are discovered automatically from the `.claude/skills/` directory — no CLI command is needed.

**To make the skill available globally across all your projects:**

Copy it into your personal Claude skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/ai-pm-prompts
cp .claude/skills/ai-pm-prompts/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/ai-pm-prompts/SKILL.md
```

Claude Code loads it automatically from that point forward — no restart required.

**Use it naturally:**

```text
"Help me run a Kano analysis on these eight features"
"Create a DACI for our mobile strategy decision"
"Build team OKRs from our company OKRs"
"Write a weekly leadership update for my VP"
```

Claude Code reads the `SKILL.md` description and trigger phrases to decide when to activate the skill, then guides you through filling the relevant prompt with your context.

---

### Install in Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop installs skills via a ZIP upload through the UI.

**Step 1 — Create the skill ZIP:**

```bash
zip -r ai-pm-prompts.zip SKILL.md prompts/ examples/
```

**Step 2 — Upload the skill:**

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to **Customize → Skills**
3. Click the **+** button → **Create skill**
4. Select **Upload a skill**
5. Upload `ai-pm-prompts.zip`
6. Toggle the skill **on**

The skill will now appear in Claude Desktop and will be suggested automatically when you ask about customer discovery, prioritization, stakeholder mapping, OKRs, strategy, or any other PM task covered by the library.

> **Note:** Code execution must be enabled in Claude Desktop settings for skills to function. For Team or Enterprise plans, your organisation owner must enable "Code execution and file creation" and "Skills" before custom skills can be uploaded.

---

### Install in Cursor

Cursor uses **rules** (`.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`) instead of skills. This repo ships with a pre-built rule that teaches Cursor's AI agent the full prompt catalog.

**Project-scoped (automatic) — no setup required:**

The rule file is already included at `.cursor/rules/pm-prompts.mdc`. When you open this repo in Cursor, it is detected automatically. Just start a conversation:

```text
"Help me run a RICE scoring session for these five features"
"Create a competitive gap analysis against Datadog and Splunk"
"Build a PESTLE analysis for our European expansion"
```

Cursor reads the rule's description and trigger phrases to decide when to activate it, then finds the right prompt template, fills in your context, and returns a ready-to-use prompt.

**Global (available across all your projects):**

Copy the rule into your personal Cursor rules directory so it works in every workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/rules
cp .cursor/rules/pm-prompts.mdc ~/.cursor/rules/pm-prompts.mdc
```

Cursor loads global rules automatically — no restart required.

> **How Cursor rules differ from Claude Code skills:** Claude Code uses `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter; Cursor uses `.mdc` files with `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` fields. Both achieve the same goal — giving the AI agent persistent context about when and how to use this prompt library.

---

### Direct copy-paste

Open any prompt file, replace `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with your context, and paste into Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot.

### With Claude Code

```bash
# Claude Code will auto-detect the SKILL.md and offer these prompts contextually
claude "Help me create an interview guide for my B2B SaaS product"
```

### With the helper script

```bash
./scripts/run-prompt.sh prompts/customer-discovery/01-interview-guide.md \
  --problem "onboarding friction for SMB users" \
  --user-type "small business owners"
```

### With the MCP Server

The `mcp-server/` directory contains a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes every prompt as a callable tool inside Claude Desktop, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, the OpenAI Agents SDK, and any other MCP-compatible client.

**Tools exposed:**

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `list_prompts` | List all prompts, optionally filtered by category |
| `get_categories` | List all categories with prompt counts and descriptions |
| `search_prompts` | Full-text search across titles, purposes, and content |
| `get_prompt` | Return the raw markdown of a prompt |
| `fill_prompt` | Fill placeholders and return a ready-to-use prompt |

**Quick setup — venv:**

```bash
cd mcp-server
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Quick setup — uv (faster, no activation step):**

```bash
cd mcp-server
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Connect to Claude Desktop** — add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pm-prompts": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/AI-Prompts-for-Product-Management/mcp-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Connect via Claude Code CLI:**

```bash
claude mcp add pm-prompts /absolute/path/to/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python /absolute/path/to/mcp-server/server.py
```

**Connect to GitHub Copilot (VS Code)** — create `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "pm-prompts": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/AI-Prompts-for-Product-Management/mcp-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: VS Code uses `"servers"` as the root key, not `"mcpServers"`. Switch Copilot Chat to **Agent** mode — MCP tools are only available there.

See [mcp-server/README.md](mcp-server/README.md) for the full setup guide including `uv` configs, OpenAI Agents SDK integration, and an MCP tutorial.

## Prompt Engineering Principles

1. **Context → Inputs → Outputs** — Every prompt follows this three-part structure
2. **Be specific** — Generic prompts produce generic outputs
3. **Iterate** — Refine your prompt if the first result isn't right
4. **Admit unknowns** — Tell the AI "I don't know this" rather than guessing
