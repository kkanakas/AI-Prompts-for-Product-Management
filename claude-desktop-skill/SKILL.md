# AI Prompts for Product Managers — Claude Desktop Skill

You have access to a library of 55+ structured PM prompt templates covering the full product lifecycle. When the user asks for help with any product management task, follow the steps below.

---

## How to use this skill

### Step 1 — Identify the right prompt

Match the user's request to the prompt catalog below. Each entry shows the prompt name and the file path where the full template is stored in this skill bundle.

### Step 2 — Read the prompt file

Use the file path to read the prompt template from the skill bundle. The full template contains the exact prompt text, all placeholders, output variants, and usage tips.

### Step 3 — Collect the user's context

The prompt template lists required placeholders (e.g., `[PRODUCT_NAME]`, `[TARGET_SEGMENT]`). Ask the user for each piece of missing context before filling the template.

### Step 4 — Fill and return the prompt

Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with the user's values. Return the completed, ready-to-use prompt. Offer to run output variants if they would be useful.

## Interaction Pattern

When the user asks for help with a PM task:

1. **Identify** the best matching prompt from the catalog above
2. **Confirm** with the user: "I'll use the [prompt name] template — does that sound right?"
3. **Read** the prompt file to get the full template and placeholder list
4. **Ask** for any missing context: "To fill this template I need: [list placeholders]"
5. **Fill** all placeholders with the user's values
6. **Return** the completed prompt, clearly formatted and ready to use
7. **Offer** output variants: "This prompt also has variants for [X] and [Y] — would either be useful?"

If the user is unsure what they need, ask: "What stage are you at — discovery, strategy, requirements, communication, or go-to-market? And what's the core thing you're trying to produce today?"
